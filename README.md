## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * This should include ALL dependencies.
  * It should also include WHERE they are defined and used in the project
  * It could include a short description of what each does for you

2. Specs

  * Spec 4: | Return their age in Jupiter years | Input: "25" | Output: "296.5" |
  * Spec 5: | Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet. | Input: "Age: 25, Life Expectancy: 70, Planet Selection: Mars" | Output: "You have 13 years left to live on Mars." |
  * Spec 6: | If user already exceeds life expectancy for the planet, return how long they have lived past it. | Input: "Age: 40, Life Expectancy: 70, Planet Selection: Mars" | Output: "You have lived 5.2 years past your life expectancy on Mars." |

## Setup

* Clone this repository @ https://github.com/iwestgate931/fivethirtyeight-clone.git
* Use a terminal of your choice (I use Git Bash) to access the webpage and its files by inputting: "git clone {the above clone link}"
* Open the folder you receive and open the index.html link in the web browser of your choice (I use Google Chrome).
* Install Node.js
* Install karma-cli globally: `npm install -g karma-cli`
* Clone the repo
* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm run start` to build and start the dev server
* `npm run lint` to explicitly run ESLint
* `npm run test` to run the unit tests with Karma and Jasmine.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
  * SASS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* jQuery 3.3.1
* Bootstrap 4.1.3
* Babel
* Webpack
* ESLint
* Jasmine
* Karma

## Known Bugs
* GH-Pages: When loaded through gh-pages, three of the images (FiveThirtyEight's Logo, ABC News' Logo, and the popularity chart) do not appear to work correctly despite working fine and connecting properly when loaded from a cloned repo.

* README: The images within the README sometimes appear next to text instead of below it, disrupting the visual clarity.
