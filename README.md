# Space Age Calculator

#### By **Ian Cook Westgate**

## Description

This Space Age Calculator is an exercise assigned by Epicodus to translate a user's age into Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter years. It will also determine how many years a user may have left to live or, alternatively, how many years they would have lived past life expectancy if they had been born on the planet of their choice of the options above.

## Specs
  * Spec 1: | Return the user's age in Mercury years | Input: "25" | Output: "6" |
  * Spec 2: | Return the user's age in Venus years | Input: "25" | Output: "15.5" |
  * Spec 3: | Return the user's age in Mars years | Input: "25" | Output: "47" |
  * Spec 4: | Return their age in Jupiter years | Input: "25" | Output: "296.5" |
  * Spec 5: | Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet. | Input: "Age: 25, Life Expectancy: 70, Planet Selection: Mars" | Output: "You have 23 years left to live on Mars." |
  * Spec 6: | If user already exceeds life expectancy for the planet, return how long they have lived past it. | Input: "Age: 40, Life Expectancy: 70, Planet Selection: Mars" | Output: "You have lived 5.2 years past your life expectancy on Mars." |
